Our mission is to progress, protect, and provide for the software and systems behind all of Google\u2019s public services - Search, Ads, Gmail, Android, YouTube, and AppEngine, to name just a few - with an ever-watchful eye on their availability, latency, performance, and capacity. \nThis is an unusual job, unlike others in the industry. Like traditional operations groups, we keep important, revenue-critical systems up and running despite hurricanes, bandwidth outages, and configuration problems. Unlike traditional operations groups, we also have full access to and authority to fix, extend, and scale the code to keep it working and harden it against all the vagaries of the Internet. We hire people from both systems and software backgrounds. Strong candidates will have experience with both. \nJust as what we do is unique, where we do it is unique too. At Google, we have the good fortune to have developed many interesting systems ranging from planet-spanning databases to near real-time scalable data warehousing to fault-tolerant datastream joining. In SRE, we flip between the fine-grained detail of disk driver I/O scheduling to the big picture of continental-level service capacity, across a range of systems and a user population measured in billions. We own those products in production. We drive reliability and performance across massive scale by mastering the full depth of the stack. We literally do learn something new every day - usually surprising things - that have the potential to transform the lives of billions of our users around the world.\nAs a Systems Engineer on the SRE team, you will work on large-scale system design and troubleshooting, and be fluent in systems programming and/or automation. You will have a desire to tackle the complex problems of scale which are unique to Google. Familiarity with running production environments at scale is crucial in this job along with an in-depth understanding of Unix systems internals, and networking.Responsibilities\nDesign, write and deliver software to improve the availability, scalability, latency, and efficiency of Google's services.\nSolve problems relating to mission critical services and build automation to prevent problem recurrence, with the goal of automating response to all non-exceptional service conditions.\nInfluence and create new designs, architectures, standards and methods for large-scale distributed systems.\nEngage in service capacity planning and demand forecasting, software performance analysis and system tuning.\nConduct periodic on-call duties using a follow-the-sun model.\nMinimum qualifications\nBS degree in Computer Science or related technical field, or equivalent practical experience.\nExperience in one or more of: C, C++, Java, Perl, Python, Go, or scripting experience in Shell and Perl.\nExperience with network theory, e.g. TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP, etc., MAC addresses, IP packets, DNS, OSI layers, and load balancing.\nExperience working with Unix/Linux systems from Kernel to Shell with experience working with system libraries, file systems, and client-server protocols.\nPreferred qualifications\nExpertise in designing, analyzing and troubleshooting large-scale distributed systems.\nIn-depth knowledge of operating systems (processes, threads, concurrency issues, locks, mutexes, semaphores, monitors and how they work).\nFamiliarity with algorithms, data structures and complexity analysis.\nSystematic problem solving approach, coupled with a strong sense of ownership and drive.\n",

Our engineers develop massively scalable, distributed software systems and also collaborate on multitudes of smaller projects that have universal appeal - which requires research, awareness, interactivity, and asking questions. You build strong competencies in data structures and algorithms, along with a technical fascination for how stuff fits together. You need to have a solid foundation in computer science in order to consistently come up with new ideas as well as strive for a deep understanding of our products and services in order to continually improve upon them. We focus on being a collaborative, global organization consisting of engineers with the highest levels of technical depth, programming skills and a keen eye for quality.As a Software Engineer, you will work on our core products and services as well as those who support critical functions of our engineering operations. Depending on your background and experience, you will be working in one of the following areas:\n\nProduct and Systems Development\nWhether it's finding new and innovative ways to advance search quality, building computing platform and networking technologies, automating the indexing of videos, or continuing to refine and scale complex auction systems (just to name a few), you will be developing solutions to some of the most challenging technical problems out there. You will research, conceive and develop software applications to extend and improve on Google's product offerings and collaborate on scalability issues involving access to massive amounts of data and information.

The test team undertakes a broad range of challenges on a daily basis, designing and building intelligent systems that can explore various use cases and scenarios for distributed computing infrastructure. Just imagine trying to design and build an automated testing system for something that's never been done before. There are no text books that can help you learn this, which is why we have some of the best and brightest engineers working in this group.\n\nSite Reliability\nSoftware engineers working in Site Reliability are involved in every facet of Google's production and work on the cutting edge of cloud-based computing.

Our engineers develop massively scalable, distributed software systems and also collaborate on multitudes of smaller projects that have universal appeal - which requires research, awareness, interactivity, and asking questions. You build strong competencies in data structures and algorithms, along with a technical fascination for how stuff fits together. You need to have a solid foundation in computer science in order to consistently come up with new ideas as well as strive for a deep understanding of our products and services in order to continually improve upon them. We focus on being a collaborative, global organization consisting of engineers with the highest levels of technical depth, programming skills and a keen eye for quality.As a Software Engineer, you will work on our core products and services as well as those who support critical functions of our engineering operations. Depending on your background and experience, you will be working in one of the following areas:Product and Systems Development\nWhether it's finding new and innovative ways to advance search quality, building computing platform and networking technologies, automating the indexing of videos, or continuing to refine and scale complex auction systems (just to name a few), you will be developing solutions to some of the most challenging technical problems out there. You will research, conceive and develop software applications to extend and improve on Google's product offerings and collaborate on scalability issues involving access to massive amounts of data and information.

Just imagine trying to design and build an automated testing system for something that's never been done before.

Unlike traditional operations groups, we also have full access to and authority to fix, extend, and scale the code to keep it working and harden it against all the vagaries of the Internet. We hire people from both systems and software backgrounds. Strong candidates will have experience with both. Just as what we do is unique, where we do it is unique too. At Google, we have the good fortune to have developed many interesting systems ranging from planet-spanning databases to near real-time scalable data warehousing to fault-tolerant datastream joining. In SRE, we flip between the fine-grained detail of disk driver I/O scheduling to the big picture of continental-level service capacity, across a range of systems and a user population measured in billions. We own those products in production. We drive reliability and performance across massive scale by mastering the full depth of the stack.
