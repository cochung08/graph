<p>I believe that there is some answer to any question. It is not the task of the users here to lecture others or criticize them for laziness or stupidity. There is little educational value in sarcasm. </p>

<p>If a question is badly formulated, one can give advice on how to do better. </p>

<p>If important information is missing, one can kindly ask for it. </p>

<p>Someone else being unfriendly or badly mannered is no justification for being so yourself.</p>

<p><em>It's the only job of where I get to be both an engineer and an artist. There's a very rigorous, technical element to it, so you have to do very precise thinking. On the other hand, it has an incredibly creative side where the boundaries of imagination are the only real limitation.</em>

<p>I started tinkering with computers at the age of 6. These days, I'm a senior software engineer at Google, currently working on Java application server infrastructure.</p>

<p>Besides being fluent in English and American Sign Language, I know too many programming languages to count. Lately I've primarily been using Java, plus some odds and ends of Python, C++, and JavaScript. I enjoy C#, even though nowadays I don't get many chances to use it. I'm also a big fan of Haskell and Scala, although I haven't had a chance to use either of them in a large-scale project yet.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I play guitar and read voraciously, including science fiction and books on computing. I'm also a volunteer minister for the deaf, teaching Bible studies in American Sign Language.</p>
