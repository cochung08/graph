A big graph
============

Making a graph of google people and projects  

Interresting things for now:

- [ ] `gh/`: 30 000+ nodes of the github users graph
- [x] `careers/`: All Google job ads
- [x] `h1b/` : Google H1B's
- [x] `papers/`: Google Research papers
- [ ] `meetups/`: Meetup.com users graph
- [ ] `hn/`: Hacker News users graph (empty)
- [ ] `stackoverflow/`: Stack Overflow users graph

**If you have an idea or want to help, tell me on twitter @dam_io!**

For more ideas, see `plan`. It's all the ideas of things I can scrape 

Why
-------

Maybe because I'm scared of falling into the [Google Vortex](http://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=201103)  
The more I look into the data, the more I'm pulled into it...

Is this any worth ?

Maybe
