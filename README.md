Google graph
============

Making a graph of google people and projects

Interresting things for now:

* `gh/`: 30 000+ nodes of the github social graph
* `careers/`: Extract all Google job ads
* `h1b/` : Google H1B's
* `papers/`: Google Research papers
* `meetups/`: Meetup.com social graph scrapper
* `plan` : all the things I can scrape
